This repository is a PoC of MetaMask clickjacking bug explained in the above video. Note that it's not made to be universal - there are hardcoded things like screen resolution and my test wallet address so it won't instantly work for you and buttons may not be aligned.

## Running the app
```
yarn install
static-server dist
```
